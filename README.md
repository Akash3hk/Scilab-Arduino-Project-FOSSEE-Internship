Name: Akash Parakandy
This is the solution of the Scilab-Arduino project that was given to me to solve before 25 Feb 2016.

As per the instructions I had created classes for Analog, Digital, DCmotor and Servomotor; also added comments 
all throughout the Python module explaining the Class, Function, Input/Output arguments and others.
